                free() in C
-----------------------------------------------
- The free() function is used to deallocate memory that was previously allocated using malloc(), calloc(), or realloc().
- It helps prevent memory leaks by releasing unused memory back to the system.
- After calling free(), the pointer still exists but becomes a **dangling pointer** if not set to NULL.
- Trying to access memory after freeing it results in **undefined behavior**.
- Freeing NULL is safe â€“ it has no effect.
- Always free dynamically allocated memory before program termination.

-----------------------------------------------
        Observing Memory Leak
-----------------------------------------------
1. Run this program and keep pressing '1'.
2. Open **Task Manager > Details** and look for the running .exe file.
3. The memory usage (RAM) of the program **keeps increasing** as memory is never freed.
4. This happens because **malloc() keeps allocating new memory** without releasing the old one.
5. If you uncomment **free(ptr);**, the memory usage will remain stable since each allocation is freed.
