Revision Notes: C++ Memory Management & RAII
1. Manual Memory Management: The Problem
What it is: Directly using new to allocate memory and delete to free it. The programmer is manually responsible for every allocation and deallocation.
Limitations & Pitfalls (Why it's hard):

➤ Forgetting to delete (Memory Leaks):
Scenario: You new an object but forget the corresponding delete.
Problem: The memory remains allocated but is no longer accessible (it's "leaked"). Your program consumes more and more memory over time, potentially crashing.
Example:
// void some_function() {
//   MyClass* obj = new MyClass();
//   // ... some work ...
//   // Oops! Forgot 'delete obj;' here. Memory is leaked when function ends.
// }


➤ Premature delete (Dangling Pointers):
Scenario: You delete an object, but other parts of your code still have pointers to that (now freed) memory.
Problem: Trying to use these "dangling" pointers leads to undefined behavior – crashes, corrupted data, etc.
Example:
// MyClass* obj = new MyClass();
// MyClass* another_ptr = obj;
// delete obj; // obj is now a dangling pointer
// // ... later ...
// another_ptr->doSomething(); // CRASH! Accessing freed memory.

➤ Double delete:
Scenario: You accidentally delete the same memory twice.
Problem: Undefined behavior, usually a crash.
Example:
// MyClass* obj = new MyClass();
// delete obj;
// // ... some complex logic ...
// delete obj; // CRASH! Deleting already deleted memory.

➤ Exception Safety Issues:
Scenario: You allocate memory, then an operation between new and delete throws an exception.
Problem: The delete statement might be skipped if an exception occurs, leading to a memory leak.
Example:
// void process_data() {
//   MyData* data = new MyData();
//   data->initialize(); // This might throw an exception
//   data->process();    // Or this might throw
//   delete data;      // If an exception happens above, this line is NEVER reached.
// }

➤ Mismatched new[]/delete or new/delete[]:
Scenario: Allocating an array with new SomeType[10] but freeing with delete ptr (instead of delete[] ptr), or vice-versa.
Problem: Undefined behavior. Only the first element's destructor might be called (for delete on an array), or memory corruption can occur.
Complexity in Code:
Manual management clutters code with new and delete calls.
In functions with multiple exit points (e.g., multiple return statements), you need to ensure delete is called before every exit path – very easy to miss one.



2. RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization)
Definition:
RAII is a C++ programming technique where you tie the lifetime of a resource (like dynamically allocated memory, file handles, network sockets, mutex locks) to the lifetime of an object on the stack.

Acquisition: The resource is acquired in the object's constructor.
Release: The resource is released in the object's destructor.

Why we use RAII (How it solves manual management problems):
● Automatic Cleanup: When an RAII object goes out of scope (e.g., function ends, object is part of another class that's destroyed), its destructor is automatically and guaranteed to be called. This ensures the resource is released.
Solves: Forgetting to delete (memory leaks).

● Exception Safety: If an exception is thrown, C++ automatically "unwinds the stack." This process calls the destructors of all objects created on the stack up to the point of the catch block (or program termination). So, even if an error occurs, the RAII object's destructor runs and releases the resource.
Solves: Memory leaks due to exceptions.

● Simplified Code: Reduces the need for manual delete calls, especially in complex functions with multiple exit points or error handling. The cleanup logic is centralized in the destructor.
Solves: Cluttered code, missed delete in complex paths.

● Prevents Dangling Pointers (when used correctly): Ownership is clear. When the RAII object managing the resource is destroyed, the resource is gone. Smart pointers (which use RAII) help manage this.
● Prevents Double delete (when used correctly): Smart pointers ensure only one owner (or shared owners) correctly deallocate.

3. Smart Pointers
Definition:
Smart pointers are class templates that act like raw pointers (you can dereference them with * and ->) but provide automatic memory management (and sometimes resource management) by leveraging the RAII principle.
They are objects that wrap a raw pointer.
When the smart pointer object itself is destroyed (e.g., goes out of scope), its destructor automatically deallocates the memory (or releases the resource) it points to.
Key Idea: You transfer ownership of dynamically allocated memory to a smart pointer object. The smart pointer's destructor handles the delete.

Common Types (examples of RAII in action for memory):
std::unique_ptr: Exclusive ownership. Only one unique_ptr can own a piece of memory. Automatically deletes when it goes out of scope.
std::shared_ptr: Shared ownership. Multiple shared_ptrs can point to the same memory. The memory is deleted only when the last shared_ptr owning it is destroyed.
std::weak_ptr: A non-owning "observer" pointer that works with std::shared_ptr to break cyclic dependencies (like the GUI example).

In essence, smart pointers are a user-friendly way to apply RAII to dynamic memory management, making C++ code safer and easier to write.
